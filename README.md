# Simulation Code for "When Do Value-Based Contracts Add Value? Insights from Probabilistic Simulation"

This Github repository contains the code used to perform the simulation and generate figures in the brief report "When Do Value-Based Contracts Add Value? Insights from Probabilistic Simulation" by Rebecca K Metcalfe, Karen Geary, Mark Trusheim, Jane F Barlow, and Jay JH Park.

To execute the simulation, run the script "01-Tipping Point Analysis-v0.5QV.R." This will execute the simulation and save the results in a file called "results5000cohortsize15and100.csv."

To generate Figure 1, run the script "03-Visualization-v0.1JP.R." View the figure by manually running the last line of the script ("combinedPlots") in R or RStudio.
